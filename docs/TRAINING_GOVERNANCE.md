# Training Data Governance

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 87 Complete

## AI Training Input Catalog

**Location:** `packages/backend-functions/src/governance/trainingData.ts`

Catalog all AI training inputs with complete data lineage and consent tracking.

## Data Lineage Tracking

Every training data record tracks:

- **Origin** - Source of the data (user input, documents, etc.)
- **Transformations** - Processing steps applied
- **Timestamp** - When data was collected/processed
- **Consent Status** - User consent state

## Consent Management

### Consent States

- **granted** - User has consented to use data for training
- **revoked** - User has revoked consent
- **pending** - Consent status unknown or pending

### Consent Actions

- Track consent grants/revocations
- Automatically redact revoked data
- Update training datasets on consent changes

## Redaction Pipeline

When consent is revoked:

1. Identify all training data from that user
2. Redact sensitive content
3. Remove from active training datasets
4. Update catalog with redaction status

## Data Catalog

Maintains complete inventory:

- Total training records
- Consent statistics
- Redaction counts
- Data lineage graphs

## Implementation Status

⚠️ **Training Data Catalog Integration Pending**

Current implementation:

- Training data record structure
- Data lineage tracking
- Consent management framework

**TODO:**

- Build training data catalog database
- Implement consent tracking API
- Create redaction pipeline
- Generate lineage reports
- Add consent UI for users
