## ⚠️ What Needs Attention

### Critical Issues (Blocks Production Rollout)

#### 1. No Health Endpoint Deployed

**Impact:** Cannot verify backend readiness programmatically  
**Status:** ❌ Not Implemented  
**Required For:** Monitoring, CI/CD validation, incident detection

**Finding:**

```bash
curl -I https://api.mosaicpolicy.com/api/health
# Returns: HTTP/2 404
```

**Resolution:** Add `/api/health` endpoint in v0.2.1  
**Estimate:** 2-4 hours  
**Blocking:** Automated health checks, monitoring alerts

---

#### 2. Manual Smoke Tests Not Executed

**Impact:** Cannot confirm end-user functionality works  
**Status:** ⏳ Pending Microsoft 365 tenant access  
**Required For:** User acceptance, functional validation

**Missing Validations:**

- [ ] Word web app - Load add-in, Apply Brand, Export PDF/A
- [ ] PowerPoint web app - Load add-in, Apply Brand, Fix All
- [ ] Outlook web app - Load add-in, Insert signature

**Resolution:** Execute smoke tests in M365 developer/test tenant  
**Estimate:** 4-6 hours (including tenant setup)  
**Blocking:** Production pilot rollout approval

---

#### 3. Telemetry Pipeline Not Verified

**Impact:** Cannot confirm observability is working  
**Status:** ⏳ Depends on smoke test execution  
**Required For:** Monitoring, analytics, incident detection

**Missing Validations:**

- [ ] Custom events recorded in Application Insights
- [ ] Events: `brand_apply`, `ppt_fix`, `pdf_export`
- [ ] Event properties include version, environment, user ID

**Resolution:** Execute smoke tests and query Application Insights  
**Estimate:** 2 hours  
**Blocking:** Production monitoring confidence

---

### Medium Priority Items (Should Fix Before Rollout)

#### 4. Accessibility Testing Not Completed

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started  
**Impact:** May have WCAG compliance violations  
**Required For:** Compliance, user experience

**Missing Validations:**

- [ ] Automated axe-core scan on all taskpanes
- [ ] Critical and Serious violations documented (target: 0)
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance report

**Resolution:** Run Playwright + axe-core tests  
**Estimate:** 3-4 hours  
**Blocking:** Compliance sign-off

---

#### 5. No Previous Version for Rollback Testing

**Status:** Expected (first deployment)  
**Impact:** Cannot test actual rollback procedure  
**Required For:** Rollback confidence

**Current State:** Rollback procedures documented but not tested in practice

**Resolution:** Test rollback during v0.2.1 deployment (rollback to v0.2.0)  
**Estimate:** 1-2 hours  
**Blocking:** Rollback confidence (not user rollout)

## 🎯 Recommended Path Forward

### Option 1: Deploy v0.2.1 with Health Endpoint (Recommended)

**Timeline:** 1-2 days

**Steps:**

1. Create health endpoint in backend-functions ✨
2. Deploy v0.2.1 to production
3. Verify health endpoint returns HTTP 200
4. Execute manual smoke tests in M365 test tenant
5. Verify telemetry pipeline
6. Run accessibility scan
7. Proceed to production pilot rollout (10% of users)

**Pros:** Lower risk, full validation before user exposure  
**Cons:** Delays user rollout by 1-2 days

---

### Option 2: Pilot with Current v0.2.0 (Higher Risk)

**Timeline:** Immediate

**Steps:**

1. Deploy to Microsoft 365 Admin Center for pilot group (5-10 users)
2. Execute manual validation with pilot users
3. Monitor Application Insights closely for 24 hours
4. Address any issues found
5. Expand rollout if successful

**Pros:** Faster time to user value  
**Cons:** No health endpoint for monitoring, unknown accessibility state

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Balanced)

**Timeline:** Same day

**Steps:**

1. Execute manual smoke tests in M365 developer tenant (4-6 hours)
2. Verify telemetry and basic accessibility
3. If all pass: Proceed with pilot to 5-10 users
4. Deploy v0.2.1 with health endpoint in next sprint
5. Full rollout after v0.2.1

**Pros:** Validates functionality before pilot, doesn't delay too much  
**Cons:** Pilot runs without health endpoint monitoring

---

## ✅ RECOMMENDATION: Option 1 (Deploy v0.2.1 First)

**Rationale:**

- Health endpoint is critical for production monitoring
- No show-stopper issues blocking quick v0.2.1 deployment
- Low risk of deploying without user validation first
- Provides confidence in telemetry before user exposure

---

## 📋 Action Items

### Immediate (Before Any User Rollout)

- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Implement `/api/health` endpoint
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Execute manual smoke tests (8 scenarios)
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Verify telemetry pipeline working

### High Priority (Before Production Rollout)

- [ ] Run accessibility scan (target: 0 Critical violations)
- [ ] Create Application Insights dashboards
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts (error rate, latency)
- [ ] Set up M365 Admin Center for pilot deployment

### Medium Priority (Can Do During Pilot)

- [ ] Test rollback procedure (during v0.2.1 → v0.2.0)
- [ ] Create GitHub Releases (not just tags)
- [ ] Document infrastructure as code (Bicep/Terraform)
- [ ] Add pre-deployment automated tests to CI

## 🎯 Production Readiness Statement

### Current Status: 🟡 NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION ROLLOUT

**Reasoning:**

1. **No health monitoring** - Cannot detect production incidents reliably
2. **No functional validation** - End-user scenarios untested
3. **No telemetry confirmation** - Observability pipeline unverified

### Required Before Production:

1. ✅ Health endpoint deployed and validated
2. ✅ Manual smoke tests pass all scenarios
3. ✅ Telemetry events confirmed in Application Insights
4. ⚠️ Accessibility scan completed (acceptable violation count)

### Ready When:

**v0.2.1 deployed with health endpoint + successful smoke tests**

**Estimated Time to Ready:** 1-2 days

---

## 🚀 Deployment Recommendation

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Create v0.2.1 branch** with health endpoint implementation
2. **Schedule M365 tenant access** for manual testing
3. **Deploy v0.2.1** to production infrastructure
4. **Execute validation** checklist with actual user scenarios
5. **Deploy to pilot group** (5-10 users) via M365 Admin Center
6. **Monitor 24-48 hours** before expanding rollout

### Pilot Criteria:

- Start with: Development/IT team members (5-10 users)
- Monitor: Application Insights dashboard every 2 hours
- Duration: 24-48 hours before expanding
- Success: < 5% error rate, no P0/P1 incidents

### Production Rollout:

- Phase 1: 10% of users (after successful pilot)
- Phase 2: 50% of users (after 7 days)
- Phase 3: 100% of users (after 14 days)
