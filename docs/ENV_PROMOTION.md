# Managed Environments Promotion

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 76 Complete (Promotion Scripts Ready)

## Environment Promotion Strategy

**Locations:**

- `scripts/environments/promote-dev.sh`
- `scripts/environments/promote-staging.sh`
- `scripts/environments/promote-prod.sh`

Promote deployments through `/dev` → `/staging` → `/prod` with validation.

## Promotion Process

1. **Validate Source Environment**
   - Run smoke tests
   - Check dependency health
   - Verify configuration

2. **Promote to Target**
   - Copy configuration
   - Deploy artifacts
   - Update environment variables

3. **Validate Target Environment**
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify endpoints
   - Check logs

4. **Rollback on Failure**
   - Automatic rollback if validation fails
   - Alert on-call engineers

## Implementation Status

✅ **Scripts Created**

Current status:

- Promotion scripts for each environment
- Validation framework
- Rollback mechanisms

**TODO:**

- Test promotion workflows
- Add approval gates
- Integrate with CI/CD
- Monitor promotion metrics
