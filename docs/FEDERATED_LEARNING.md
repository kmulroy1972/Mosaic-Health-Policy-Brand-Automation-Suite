# Federated Learning Pilot

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 105 Complete (Framework Ready)

## Secure Federated Training

**Location:** `packages/backend-functions/src/learning/federated.ts`

Allows tenants to train local models and share weights securely without exposing raw data.

## Federated Learning Process

1. **Local Training** - Each tenant trains model on local data
2. **Weight Extraction** - Extract model weights (not raw data)
3. **Secure Aggregation** - Aggregate weights from multiple tenants
4. **Global Model Update** - Update global model with aggregated weights
5. **Distribution** - Distribute updated model to all tenants

## Privacy Protection

- **No Raw Data Sharing** - Only model weights shared
- **Differential Privacy** - Add noise to protect individual contributions
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation** - Cryptographic aggregation
- **Consent Management** - Explicit consent required

## Implementation Status

⚠️ **Federated Learning Implementation Pending**

Current implementation:

- Federated learning framework
- Weight aggregation structure
- Privacy protection mechanisms

**TODO:**

- Implement federated averaging algorithm
- Build secure aggregation service
- Add differential privacy
- Create consent management UI
- Test with pilot tenants
