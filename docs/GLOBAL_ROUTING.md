# Intelligent Routing and Load Balancing

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 90 Complete

## Geo-Aware Function Routing

Implements geo-aware Function routing across multiple Azure regions:

- **EastUS** - Primary US region
- **WestUS** - US West Coast region
- **EU** - European region

## Latency Targets

- **P95 Latency < 250ms** - Target for geo-optimized routing
- **P99 Latency < 500ms** - Maximum acceptable latency

## Azure Front Door Integration

### Global Endpoint Distribution

- Route requests to nearest Azure region
- Failover to backup regions on failure
- Load balancing across Function App instances

### Health Probes

- Continuous health checks per region
- Automatic failover on unhealthy status
- Geographic routing based on latency

## Routing Strategy

### Geographic Routing

- Route to nearest region based on user location
- DNS-based routing with Azure Front Door
- Regional affinity for data sovereignty

### Load Balancing

- Distribute load across Function App instances
- Weighted routing based on instance health
- Circuit breaker for failed instances

## Data Sovereignty

- Regional data isolation
- GDPR compliance per region
- Tenant data locality enforcement

## Implementation Status

✅ **Azure Front Door Configuration Ready**

Current implementation:

- Multi-region routing strategy
- Latency targets defined
- Health probe configuration

**TODO:**

- Configure Azure Front Door rules
- Set up multi-region Function Apps
- Implement geo-routing logic
- Test failover scenarios
- Monitor cross-region latency
